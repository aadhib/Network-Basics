# Network Basics
Basic networking programs using C can cover a wide range of topics, including communication protocols such as UDP and TCP, file transfer protocols such as FTP, and routing algorithms used in networking.

UDP and TCP are two of the most common communication protocols used in networking. UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol, which is a connectionless protocol that allows for fast, low-latency communication between two endpoints. TCP, or Transmission Control Protocol, is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered delivery of data between two endpoints.

File Transfer Protocol, or FTP, is a protocol used for transferring files between computers on a network. FTP is widely used for uploading and downloading files between a client and a server, and it can be implemented using C.

Routing algorithms are used to determine the best path for data to travel between two endpoints on a network. Some common routing algorithms include Distance Vector Routing, Link State Routing, and Path Vector Routing. These algorithms can be implemented using C to help optimize network traffic and ensure reliable communication between endpoints.

## Programs
1. UDP 
2. TCP
3. FTP
4. Link State
5. Distance Vector Routing
6. Leaky Bucket
7. Go back N
8. Stop and Wait

## How to run - Ubuntu
1. Clone the repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/aadhib/Network-Basics.git
```
2. Get into the folder
```
cd Network-Basics-main
```
> There are Two programs (Client and Server) for some Programs so run those two in Different Terminals
3. Compile the C program 
```
gcc pgmname.c
```
4. Run the C program
```
./a.out
```
